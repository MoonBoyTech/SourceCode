Moonboy strategically launched on Earth Day, April 22nd 2021 by an international team of professional coders and designers with the common Mission of creating a Crypto Currency with ample rewards for Community Members. MoonBoy is an autonomous yield and liquidity generation protocol that directly rewards the holders while continuously increasing liquidity. The token rewards the Community members for holding through the Automatic Fee-Share contract which equally and fairly distributes transaction fees to all of its holders.

The #MOONBOY community has steadily been building and the support has been incredible. #MOONBOY was developed with the community in mind and we have shown this right from the very beginning by addressing community concerns regarding safety/security, marketing, tokenomics, the #MOONBOY team, and more.

The first community concern addressed was Tokenomics. As we wanted to swiftly eradicate all possibilities of large amounts of tokens being held on developer smart contracts. Thus, 98.9% of the supply of tokens were burned, that is 989 Trillion tokens (The largest cryptocurrency token burn to date!). The remaining supply is 1.02 Trillion, of which the large majority is in locked LP contracts. MoonBoy is fully audited, open source and secure. Through our "Moon Missions" MoonBoy aims to onboard many features and tech into the platform including NFTs, Swaps and dAPPs. We invite all Dreamers, Visionaries and Adventures to join our Community.
